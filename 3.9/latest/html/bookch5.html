<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >In addition to the Scout runtime framework presented in the previous chapter, Eclipse Scout also includes
a comprehensive tooling, the Scout SDK. Thanks to this tooling, developing Scout applications is made
simpler, more productive and also more robust. Initially, a solid understanding of the Java language is
sufficient to start developing Scout applications and only a rough understanding of the underlying
Eclipse/OSGi/JEE technologies is required.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >    The Scout SDK consists of navigation support for the application model defined by the Scout
runtime and provides many intuitive component wizards. This creates an ideal environment to
beginners for building complete, high-quality Scout applications. Typically, Java developers only
need a few days of Scout training to start creating their own advanced client server business
applications.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >    The Scout SDK also helps developers to become more productive. Many repetitive and error prone
tasks run automatically in the background or are taken care of by the component wizards of the Scout
SDK. This starts with the initial creation of a Scout client server application, continues with the wizards
to create complete dialogs and pages and includes the automatic management of the data transfer objects
needed by the client server communication.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >    Finally, the application code created by the Scout SDK wizards helps to ensure that the resulting
Scout application has a consistent and robust code base and is well aligned with the application model
defined by the Scout runtime framework.

With the Scout Explorer and Scout Objects Properties, two view parts are contained in the Scout
perspective. Additionally, the Scout SDK contains a comprehensive set of wizards that support the
developer in creating Scout application components.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >    The Scout Explorer view allows the developer to navigate the complete Scout application model.
Once an element in the Scout Explorer is selected, the Scout Object properties view allows to view and
change selected properties of the selected element. Depending on the selected element in

wizards.

in the upper left part of the screenshot, the message field in the desktop form of the &#8221;Hello World&#8221;
application is selected. In the Scout Object Properties located below, the message field&#8217;s appearance,
layout and behaviour properties are displayed. On the right side, the corresponding source code is loaded
in a Java editor.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >    When the developer changes a property of the selected element, the Java code is updated
accordingly. For example, clicking the <span

field will insert the method <span

Scout SDK directly works on the Java source code. In fact, the Java source code is the only artefact
relevant for the Scout SDK to &#8217;understand&#8217; the Scout application model. Taking advantage of this
setup, the Scout SDK implements a full round-trip-engineering from creating the Java code for
Scout application components, parsing code changes in the background, and displaying the
current implementation of the Scout application in the Scout Explorer and the Scout Object
Properties.

provides the flexibility to develop Scout applications with or without the support of the Scout

provided. Initially, all possible plugins are checked which is useful to quickly demonstrate a &#8221;Hello World&#8221;
application. However, for a typical setup only one or two UI plugins will be needed. To develop a
mobile/web application only the RAP UI plugin is necessary. For a desktop only client, either the Swing
or the SWT UI plugin will be needed. And in cases where the client needs to run both on the desktop and
as a web/mobile application, the RAP and a desktop UI plugin can be chosen. A Scout application
must not necessarily be a client-server application. It is also possible to create a client only
or a server only application. But make sure to include the shared plugin in all possible use
cases.
<!--l. 346--><p class="indent" >    The content of the <span

then detects whether the provided location contains a complete target platform or only the RAP target

Otherwise, the plugins available to the running Eclipse and the content of the provided directory jointly
define the target platform.
