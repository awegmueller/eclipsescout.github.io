Scout applications may run as a desktop application, in a web browser or on a mobile phone
with touch support. The clean separation of Scout&#8217;s client model from the user interface
technologies allows the developer to concentrate on a single code base. This approach has
advantages for end users of Scout applications, Scout developers, and organisations implementing
Scout applications. In the text below we will explain Scout from the perspective of these three
roles.

enterprise application to highlight how Scout applications can provide user friendly UIs on the desktop, in

locally installed software such as Lotus Notes or Microsoft Office products can significantly boost
productivity. So far, such a scenario still requires a desktop client application. An example screenshot of a

communications is provided. Once an entity is selected, a click on the magnifying glass opens a
search form on the right hand side. In this search form a number of search fields is provided.
After entering &#8221;eclipse&#8221; into the company search field &#8211; and clicking the search button at the

<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >    When a user needs to work from a computer that does not have a desktop client installed (or lacks
the time or the necessary permission to install software) the natural choice is to work with a web
application. As Scout offers multi-frontend capabilities out of the box, a web frontend can easily be
provided for Scout business applications. The primary benefits of Scout web applications
for end users are a consistent look and feel and behaviour for both the web client and the
desktop client. In Figure&#x00A0;<a

<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >    Often, user find themselves in meetings or on the move where it is not possible to work with desktop
or laptop computers. In such situations, accessing applications via tablets or mobile phones is the only
meaningful approach. As shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-110033">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bsi_crm_mobile --></a>, a screenshot of the familiar CRM application is provided.
The user still benefits from the familiar look and feel and the known functionality of the
application.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >    In contrast to desktop and web applications, most tablets and mobile phones are controlled using
touch features instead of mouse clicks. In addition, less elements may be presented on a single screen
compared to desktop devices. These two aspects makes it impractical to directly reuse the desktop user
interface on mobile devices. Using the Scout mobile extension, the user interface of Scout applications can
be transformed on the fly to adapt to touch control and the smaller form factor of mobile devices. This
transformation can be observed when comparing the company table shown in the background of
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-110011">1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bsi_crm_desktop --></a> with the company list presented in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-110033">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:bsi_crm_mobile --></a>. The multi-column table of the desktop client
has been transformed into a list providing the content of the first few table columns on separate rows.
In addition, the context menu &#8221;New company&#8221; is now provided as a touch button. As the
navigation in the application and the offered choices remain the same for Scout desktop and
mobile applications, the end user feels immediately comfortable working with Scout mobile
applications.

<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >For the management, Scout is best explained in terms of benefits it brings to the organisation in question.
This is why we are going to concentrate on a (typical) application migration scenario here. Let us assume
that to support the company&#8217;s business, a fairly large landscape of multi-tier applications has to be
maintained and developed. Including host systems, client server applications including desktop clients, as
well as newer web based applications.

Often, some of the applications that are vital to the organisation&#8217;s core business have grown historically
and are based on legacy technologies. And for technologies that are no longer under active development it
can get difficult to find staff having the necessary expertise or motivation. Sometimes, the
organisation is no longer willing to accept the costs and technology risks of such mission critical
applications.

<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >    In this situation, the company needs to evaluate if it should buy a new standard product or if the old
application has to be migrated to a new technology stack. Now let us assume, that available products do
not fit the company&#8217;s requirements well enough and we have to settle for the migration scenario.
In the target architecture, a clean layering similar to the one shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-120025">1.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_integration --></a> is often
desirable.
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >    While a number of modern and established technologies exist that address the backend side (data
bases, data access and business services), the situation is different for the UI layer and the
application layer. The number of frameworks to develop web applications with Java is excessively
large<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="book16.html#fn1x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x15-12003f1"></a> ,
but the choice between desktop application technologies in the Java domain is restricted to three options
only. Swing, SWT and JavaFX. Both Eclipse SWT and Java Swing are mature and well established but
Swing is moving into &#8217;maintenance only&#8217; mode and will be replaced by JavaFX. However, the maturity of
the new JavaFX technology in large complex enterprise applications is not yet established. Obviously,
deciding for the right UI technology is a challenge and needs to be made very carefully. Reverting this
decision late in a project or after going into production can get very expensive and time
consuming.
<!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >    Once the organisation has decided for a specific UI technology, additional components and
frameworks need to be evaluated to cover client server communication, requirements for the application
layer, and integration into the existing application landscape. To avoid drowning in the integration effort
for all the elements necessary to cover the UI and the application layer a &#8217;lightweight&#8217; framework is
frequently developed. When available, this framework initially leads to desirable gains in productivity.
Unfortunately, such frameworks often become legacy by themselves. Setting up a dedicated team to
actively maintain the framework and adapt to new technologies can reduce this risk. But then again, such
a strategy is expensive and developing business application frameworks is usually not the core business of
a company.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >    Can we do better? To implement a business application that covers the UI and the application layer
as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-120025">1.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_integration --></a>, Eclipse Scout substantially reduces both risk and costs compared to the inhouse
development presented above. First or all, Scout is completely based on Java and Eclipse. Chances are,
that developers are already familiar with some of these technologies. This helps in getting developers up
to speed and keeping training costs low.
<!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >    On the UI side, Scout&#8217;s multi-frontend support almost allows to skip the decision for a specific UI
technology. Should a particular web framework become the de-facto standard in the next years, it
will be the responsibility of the Scout framework to provide the necessary support. Existing
Scout applications can then switch to this new technology with only minimal effort. This is
possible because the Scout developers are designing and building the UI of an application using
Scout&#8217;s client model. And this client model is not linked to any specific UI technology. Rather,
specific UI renderers provided by the Scout framework are responsible to draw the UI at
runtime.
<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >    As Scout is an open source project, no licence fees are collected. Taking advantage of the growing
popularity of Scout, free community support is available via a dedicated forum. At the same time,
professional support is available if the organisation decides for it.
                                                                                 

                                                                                 
<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >    As the migration of aging applications to current technology is always a challenge, it surely helps to
have Scout in the technology portfolio. Not only is it a low risk choice, but also boosts developer
productivity and helps to motivate the development team.

<!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >    </div><hr class="endfigure">
<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >    As Scout is completely based on Java and Eclipse, Scout developers can take full advantage of
existing knowledge and experience in these domains. And to make learning Scout as simple as possible,
Scout includes a comprehensive software development kit (SDK), the Scout SDK. The Scout SDK helps
to create a robust initial project setup for client server applications and includes a large set of wizards for
repetitive and error prone tasks. The architecture of a Scout client server created by the Scout SDK is
shown in In Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-130016">1.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_app_architecture_desktop --></a>.
<!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >    On the client-side Scout&#8217;s flexible client model allows the developer to create a good user experience
without having to care about specific UI technologies. The reason for this can be found in Scout&#8217;s client
architecture that cleanly separates the UI model from the UI technology. This is illustrated in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-130016">1.6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_app_architecture_desktop --></a>
and Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x15-130027">1.7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:scout_app_architecture_web --></a> where the Scout UI rendering compontents for Swing, SWT and RAP are shown to be
part of the Scout framwork itself. The price of this architecture is the fact, that in Scout
(almost) every UI component is implemented four times. First the implementation of the UI
model component and then, three rendering components for each UI technology supported by
Scout. For desktop clients these are the Swing and the SWT technologies, and for the web
and mobile support this is Eclipse RAP which in turn takes care of the necessary JavaScript
parts.
<!--l. 179--><p class="indent" >    Not having to worry about Swing, SWT or JavaScript can significantly boost the productivity. With
one exception. If a specific UI widget is missing for the user story to be implemented, the Scout developer
first needs to implement such a widget. Initially, this task is slightly more complex than not
working with Scout. For custom widgets the Scout developer needs to implement both a model
component and a rendering component for a specific UI technology. But as soon as the client
application needs to be available on more than a single frontend, the investment already pays off.
The developer already did implement the model component and only needs to provide an
additional rendering component for the new UI technology. In most situations the large set of
Scouts UI components provided out-of-the box are sufficient and user friendly applications are
straight forward to implement. Even if the application needs to run on different target devices
simultaneously.
<!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >    Client-server communication is an additional aspect where the developers is supported by Scout.
Calling remote services in the client application that are provided by the Scout server looks identical to
the invocation of local services. The complete communication including the transfer of parameter objects
is handled fully transparent by the Scout framework. In addition, the Scout SDK can completely manage
the necessary transfer objects to fetch data from the Scout server that is to be shown in dialog forms
on the Scout client. The binding of the transferred data to the form fields is done by the
framework.
<!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >    Although the Scout SDK wizards can generate a significant amount of code, there is no one-way code
generation and no meta data in a Scout application. Just the Java code. Developers preferring to write
the necessary code manually, may do so. The Scout SDK parses the application&#8217;s Java code in the
background to present the updated Scout application model to the developers preferring to work with the
Scout SDK.
<!--l. 202--><p class="indent" >    Finally, Scout is an open source framework hosted at the Eclipse foundation. This provides a number
of interesting options to developers that are not available for closed source frameworks. First of all,
it is simple to get all the source code of Scout and the underlying Eclipse platform. This
allows for complete debugging of all problems and errors found in Scout applications. Starting
from the application code, including the Scout framework, Eclipse and down to the Java
platform.
                                                                                 

                                                                                 
<!--l. 208--><p class="indent" >    Scout developer can also profit from an increasing amount of free and publicly available
documentation, such as this book or the Scout Wiki pages. And problems with Scout or questions that
are not clearly addressed by existing documentation can be discussed in the Scout forum. The
forum is also a great place for Scout developers to help out in tricky situation and learn from
others. Ideally, answered questions lead to improved or additional documentation in the Scout
Wiki.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >    At times, framework bugs can be identified from questions asked in the forum. As all other
enhancement requests and issues, such bugs can be reported in Bugzilla by the Scout developer. Using
Bugzilla, Scout developers can also contribute bug analysis and patch proposals to solve the reported
issue. With this process, Scout developers can actively contribute to the code base of Eclipse Scout. This
has the advantage, that workarounds in existing Scout applications can be removed when an upgrade of
the Scout framework is made.
<!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >    Having provided a significant number of high quality patches and a meaningful involvement in the Scout
community, the Scout project can nominate a Scout developer as a new Scout committer. Fundamentally,
such a nomination is based on the trust of Scout committers in the candidate. To quote the official
guidelines<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Or this book. If you find a bug in Eclipse Scout that makes your life miserable you can report it. When
your bug is fixed, you can test the fix. To help speed up the bug fixing process you can contribute
